        <h3>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>I would like to be part of meaningful projects as a software developer in New Zealand.</p>
        <h3>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</h3>
        <p>I believe creativity and passion are the strengths that would help me in my learning journey. As for
            limitations, I often find it hard to open up and be vulnerable about my struggles. This might affect
            productivity.</p>
        <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>I am working on growing problem-solving skills and improving focus.</p>
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
        <p>I work most effectively while taking timely breaks to avoid fatigue. Changing activities also helps restore
            focus.</p>
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
        <p>If I am stuck for some time and googling doesn't help I will probably take a break and try again later. If it
        doesn't work, I will ask for help in Slack.</p>
        <h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team.</h3>
        <p>It would be great to hear some suggestions on how to improve and some general feedback for the challenges</p>

        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you
            might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
        <p>My toddler is going to daycare. My husband will do the pick-ups during bootcamp. If for some reason he won't be
        able to do this I will discuss the situation with my facilitator and let the peers know.</p>

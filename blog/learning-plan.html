        <!-- BOOTCAMP -->

        <h1 class="title">BOOTCAMP LEARNING PLAN</h1>
        <h3>What is your long-term goal and/or career pathway?</h3>
        <p>I would like to be part of meaningful projects as a software developer in New Zealand.</p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in Bootcamp?</h3>
        <p>I believe almost all of my strengths and limitations are still the same. Perseverance and passion are the
            strengths that would help me in my learning journey. As for limitations, I sometimes found it hard to open
            up
            and be vulnerable about my struggles during Foundations, but I have been working on it. Also, I'm getting
            better at dealing with perfectionism - learning to accept a working solution, not the perfect one.</p>

        <h3>What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will be?</h3>
        <p>I believe I will face a few non-technical challenges during bootcamp - staying on top of the material,
            maintaining life - study balance, stress management.</p>

        <h3>What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>I would like to develop the ability to work in groups, my communication skills, especially public speaking
            skills. After bootcamp I am planning to join Toastmasters club to keep improving my social skills.
            Besides, I intend to nurture my reflective skills.</p>

        <h3>What are your expectations from the Bootcamp team?</h3>
        <p>It would be great to hear some suggestions on how to improve and some general support and feedback for the
            challenges</p>
        <h3>What are your expectations of yourself on Bootcamp</h3>
        <p>I will do my best to work perpetually in order to achieve the goals on time.</p>
        <p> I will perceive any constructive feedback with gratitude and take it as an incentive to grow.</p>
        <p>I will be mindful of the other team members and offer my assistance if I can help.</p>
        <p> I will do my best to look after myself to avoid burnout. I will also be watchful of my progress and will
            alter
            my learning style to achieve better results if I need to.</p>



        <!-- FOUNDATIONS-->
        <h1 class="title">FOUNDATIONS LEARNING PLAN</h1>

        <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
        </h3>
        <p>I am working on growing problem-solving skills and improving focus.</p>
        <h3>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. </h3>
        <p>I work most effectively while taking timely breaks to avoid fatigue. Changing activities also helps restore
            focus.</p>
        <h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
        <p>If I am stuck for some time and googling doesn't help I will probably take a break and try again later. If it
            doesn't work, I will ask for help in Slack.</p>

        <h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you
            might have whƒÅnau commitments like school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.</h3>
        <p>My toddler is going to daycare. My husband will do the pick-ups during bootcamp. If for some reason he won't
            be
            able to do this I will discuss the situation with my facilitator and let the peers know.</p>

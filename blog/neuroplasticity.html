        <h3>Neuroplasticity as the power to improve your brain</h3>
        <!--  <div class="media">
            <img class="html-css" src="resources/images/HTML-CSS-analogy.jpg" />
        </div> -->
        <p>Neuroplasticity is your brain's ability to make new connections, adapt.</p>

        <p>To see neuroplasticity in action let's remember the first time you drove a car. Early in the game, it
            probably was quite exciting and maybe even heart-pounding, but the more practice you had the earsier it felt
            to perform this action. Now you can find yourself driving a car on autopilot. This happens because when you
            do something repeatedly, you build neuropathways in your brain. The more you practise, the stronger these
            new paths get, and consequently, the easier it eventually becomes to perform a certain action.
        </p>
        <p>"Neuroplasticity is a marathon, not a sprint," Priscilla Hidalgo.
            The key to taking advantage of neuroplasticity is consistency. If you are consistent about doing certain
            activities, accomplishing these particular tasks will become automatic with time.
        </p>
        <p>So what are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Seek novelty</li>
            <li>Utilize brain games</li>
            <li>Learn a language</li>
            <li>Learn to play a musical instrument</li>
            <li>Rest when you are tired</li>
            <li>Exercise regularly</li>
            <li>Adopt a healthy diet</li>
            <li>Connect with others</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Growth mindset</h3>
        <p>A growth mindset is the belief that your intelligence and abilities are all susceptible to growth, and can be
            improved with effort and persistence.
        </p>
        <p>“With a growth mindset, you tend to believe you have the potential to succeed and improve and get better, and
            your focus is on learning and growth, not on the outcome.”
        </p>
        <p>“With a fixed mindset, you tend to worry about the outcome more. With a growth mindset, you tend to worry
            about the journey and therefore you're not as worried about challenges and setbacks. They are just part of
            the process of getting better.”
        </p>
        <p>“Someone with a growth mindset believes they can, and will, become competent. They approach new challenges
            with an “optimistic drive”. <a target="_blank"

        <p>I was pleased to discover the article <a target="_blank"
                href="https://www.opencolleges.edu.au/informed/features/develop-a-growth-mindset/">25 Ways to Develop a
                Growth Mindset by Saga Briggs.</a> Realizing that your mindset can be cultivated at any point in life can
            bring heaps of positive changes, as well as viewing challenges as opportunities, not problems. People with a
            growth mindset tend to forget the word “failure” and replace it with the word “learning” as they focus on
            what can be done differently next time. I believe having a growth mindset is crucial in the coding world as
            you face problems daily and you need to be able to perceive them in a healthy way.</p>

        <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>
        <p>Understanding the concepts of neuroplasticity and growth mindset will guide me through my learning journey.
            I hope that with proper practice in place I will feel empowered and committed while <span

            embracing the challenges.

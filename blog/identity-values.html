        <h3>Describe your core personal values</h3>
        <p>While thinking of the desired superpower as a kid, all I wanted was to look at the world through someone
            else's eyes, relate to their feelings. I don't recall when I noticed that this superpower was real, and I
            was blessed to have it. Later on, I realized it's something adults call "empathy". I have been reflecting on
            empathy quite a lot during the past few years, since it seems to be the key to solving multiple problems
            these days.
            Focus and simplicity are the values I am mastering at the moment.</p>

        <h3> Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values
            involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
        <p>I remember facing ethical dilemmas quite often during my first year of studying at the uni. If I said I never
            cheated during the exams it would be a lie. Analyzing my exam experience, I started to realize that cheating
            makes me feel absolutely exhausted and the perspective of getting a lower grade (my TRUE grade) started to
            seem way more pleasing than experiencing self-blame, shame and guilt. Besides, it was useless in terms of
            self-improvement and pushing my boundaries. Most importantly, I finally became fully aware of the fact that
            betraying the trust of the tutors and the belief in my own abilities was not ethically correct and unfair.
            Thus, I managed to quit cheating, and I am pleased I was able to take this step.</p>

        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>I grew up in the Far East of Russia. Integrity, commitment, quality orientation are some of the values I
            observed in people around me. My parents tried to avoid telling me what was right or wrong - they have
            always served as an example of honesty and balance to me.</p>

        <h3>Describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
        <h4>Strengths:</h4>
        <h4>I amâ€¦</h4>
        <p><em>Creative</em>- I enjoy using my imagination in order to find a suitable solution for a problem.
            Creativity is
            the value you never cease to nurture.</p>
        <p><em>Insightful</em> - This quality gives me the ability to understand people's true motivations, feelings,
            and needs.</p>
        <p><em>Passionate</em> - I often find myself devoting a lot of time doing what I find important. However, a
            certain
            balance should be maintained here to avoid feeling overwhelmed.</p>
        <p><em>Altruistic</em> - I generally aim to use my strengths for the greater good, tending to think about how my
            actions
            affect others, and my goal is to behave in a way that will help the people around me and make the world a
            better place :)</p>

        I believe creativity and passion are the strengths that would help me in my learning journey.
        <h4>Limitations:</h4>
        <h4>I am...</h4>
        <p><em>Reluctant to Open Up</em> - I often find it hard to open up and be vulnerable about my struggles. This
            might
            affect productivity and be a bit stressful.</p>
        <p><em>Perfectionistic</em> - I often tend to find the best solution. However, I am now focusing on finding just
            a
            WORKING solution rather than the perfect one.</p>
        <p><em>Prone to Burnout</em> - My perfectionism may leave me with few options for letting off steam. People like
            me can
            exhaust themselves if they don't find a way to balance their drive to help others with necessary self-care
            and rest.</p>


        <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there
            was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your
            reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h3>
        <p>After finding my first job as a teacher in Russia, I felt some tension working with a group of adults. Since
            I just graduated from the uni and didn't have any relevant teaching experience, my ability to fulfill this
            role was gloomily questioned by one of the students :)
            It took me about a week to resolve this issue.
            First, I did my best at <strong>identifying what the student's learning goal was, understanding his
                motives</strong>. It
            turned out he was pressed for time and stressed out due to this fact.
            When I had a clear picture of his needs, I <strong>adjusted his learning plan</strong> and created some
            extra learning
            material and personal learning tips for him. When a big goal was divided into a number of
            <strong>sub-goals</strong> it felt
            way easier for both of us to achieve it. How about adding a bit of inspiration? - I didn't miss this step!
            Quite quickly resistance changed to gratitude.

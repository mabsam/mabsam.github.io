        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
        <p>Emotional Intelligence is the ability to recognize, understand and manage our own emotions and to perceive
            and respond effectively to those of others.</p>
        <p>There are four key elements of emotional intelligence:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>self-awareness - ability to recognize your emotions and how they affect your way of thinking and
                behavior.</li>
            <li>self-regulation - ability to control impulsive emotions and behaviors, manage your emotions in a healthy
                way.</li>
            <li>social awareness - ability to accurately understand the emotions, needs, and concerns of other people.
            </li>
            <li>relationship management - ability to connect with others, maintain positive relationships, communicate
                clearly, inspire and influence others, and manage conflict.</li>
        </ul>


        <h3>How is it different to IQ?</h3>
        <p>The main difference between Emotional Quotient and Intelligence Quotient is what they measure.</p>
        <p>IQ measures intellectual abilities: use of logic, ability to understand abstract ideas, plan, adapt to
            change, while EQ measures an ability to recognize and regulate your own emotions and understand emotions of
            other
            people. It also refers to how you use that awareness to guide your behavior.</p>

        <h3>Why is it important?</h3>
        <p>The intelligent use of emotions is a fundamental mechanism in psychological adaptation and well-being.
            Individuals with higher EI have been found to report lower levels of stress and higher levels of happiness,
            indicating that the ability to regulate perceived stress directly impacts satisfaction (Ruiz-Aranda,
            Extremera & Pineda-Gal√°n, 2014).
        </p>
        <p> High emotional intelligence increases your ability to deal with a wide range of emotionally challenging
            scenarios. Lack of ability to cope with stress can lead to serious health issues, since stress weakens your
            immune system. It can also affect your mental health, making you more vulnerable to depression and anxiety.
        </p>
        <p>Nurturing emotional intelligence not only helps you better manage your emotions but also empowers you to
            communicate more effectively and build stronger relationships. Thus, EI can help you increase your
            performance at work, excel in your career, improve your well-being in general, and empowers you to better understand yourself.</p>

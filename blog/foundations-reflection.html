        <h1 class="title">CORE REFLECTION</h1>
        <h3>Three things I have learned about myself and my ego as a result of the core learning</h3>
        <p>The importance of a growth mindset. While coding you deal with multiple problems, sometimes rather
            exhausting. Keeping in mind that our intelligence and skills are susceptible to growth is the key to having
            a healthy learning mindset. I realized that it empowers me to keep trying, even if I am stuck with a
            challenge for a while. Another thing I was working on was mastering attention - doing sports and meditation
            practices helps me stay tuned and focused.</p>
        <p>During Foundations I was also trying to create useful mental habits in order to deal with self-criticism.
        </p>

        <h3>The role of values, empathy, and self awareness in learning and programming</h3>
        <p>The decisions we make every day are a reflection of our values. Keeping in mind the fact that people around
            you can have very different values from yours can help you better understand others, accept their choices
            and avoid misunderstanding.</p>

        <p>Empathy to others and yourself can help create a healthy working environment. Besides, it enables web
            developers to identify problems others may be facing and find suitable solutions.</p>

        <p>Self-awareness not only allows me to make better choices, but also helps me live in the present which makes
            me more productive. Accepting my weaknesses and cherishing my strengths helps me better understand my
            potential and keep learning.</p>


        <h3> What surprised me the most about the core learning was</h3>
        <p> I was surprised by the fact that working on developing soft skills brings results quite quickly.</p>

        <h3> The most challenging aspects of the core learning</h3>
        <p> I found it hard to be consistent while working on core challenges. Understanding the importance of
            reflecting,
            meditating etc. I kept trying to do it regularly but sometimes I realized I spent way more time trying to
            find
            solutions to coding challenges than I was supposed to, and thus didn't have enough time to journal and
            reflect.
            I will keep working on it.</p>

        <h3>Why spend so much time focusing on core learning in a web
            development bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p>Coding is only a part of programming, there are a lot more aspects that should be taken into consideration.
            Ability to work as a team, communication skills, problem-solving skills, perseverance are just a few other
            aspects that help a web developer create a healthy working environment and work more efficiently.</p>

        <h3>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used
            that
            time to practise programming instead? </h3>
        <p> I am very enthusiastic about studying core learning. The topics that I found the most helpful and
            interestion are: neuroplasticity, emotional intelligence, identity and values. I truly enjoy the learning
            material, besides it is always a good idea to take breaks from coding when you get tired, and work on something different. Changing learning
            activities helps me stay focused.</p>

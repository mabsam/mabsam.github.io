        <h1 class="title">RELATIVE, ABSOLUTE, AND FIXED POSTITIONING</h1>

        <p>While designing websites you need to control how elements behave and are displayed on the page.
            Let's say you wish to position elements next to each other or fix a certain element at the top of your page.
            That's when CSS's position property comes into play.
            Though it's mighty of doing much more and takes in five values: static, relative, absolute, fixed, and
            sticky, today we'll be focusing on the relative, absolute and fixed values.</p>

        <h4> Learning Competencies:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><em>Compare relative, absolute and fixed positions to determine their differences.</em></li>
            <li><em> Explain how to use these values.</em></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>POSITION: RELATIVE </h3>
        <p>Relative value allows you to position an element relative to its default static position on the page.
            However, if you just give an element position: relative it will not change its location. To move a
            relatively positioned element you need to tell it where to go by accompanying the position declaration with
            one or more of the following properties:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><em>top - moves the element down from the top.</em></li>
            <li><em>bottom - moves the element up from the bottom.</em></li>
            <li><em>left - moves the element away from the left side (to the right).</em></li>
            <li><em>right - moves the element away from the right side (to the left).</em></li>
        </ul>
        <div class="media">
            <img src="resources/images/dancing-container.jpg" />
        </div>
        <p>In the given example, the element will be moved down 25 pixels, and to the right 40 pixels from its default
            static position. Let's see how the element will be displayed:</p>
        <div class="media">
            <img src="resources/images/relative.jpg" />
        </div>
        <h3>POSITION: ABSOLUTE</h3>
        <p>When an element has position: absolute, all other elements will act like it does not exist on the page. It
            makes position: absolute very useful when you want to stick an element in a specific position, but you do
            not want anything else to move around it.</p>
        <p>The position of the absolute element is determined by its parent element, so the element will be located
            relative to its closest parent element. Top, bottom, left, right properties allow you to modify the final
            position of the element.</p>
        </p>
        <h3>POSITION: FIXED</h3>
        <p>Fixed position is similar to absolute position since it removes the element from the document flow, but fixed
            position elements are always positioned relative to the screen no matter what position its parent elements
            are.</p>
        <p>Fixed positioned elements stay on the screen when you scroll.</p>

        <div class="media">
            <img src="resources/images/fixed.jpg" />
        </div>
        <p>In the example above the child-container completely ignores the parent position and moves to the very top of
            the screen. It sticks to the top right corner and stays there when you scroll. </p>

    </div>

        <h3>A time I got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
        <p>I was working on JS-Gradebook Kata exercise and got stuck for about half an hour when I reached the task asking to
            create a "getAverage" function. I knew that I needed to create a function that 1) accepts a name of a student
            as a string 2) returns that student's average score. I was also supposed to use the previously created
            "average" function as part of this new function. No prob, I can try to do this! Then I wrote a code block
            that I assumed should have worked, but it didn't pass the test. I altered the code and tried again, then I
            googled and even explained the problem to my daughter's doll (her face has never been that sympathetic),
            which encouraged me to get back to my initial code. What a surprise it was to notice that the name of the
            function I was referring to ("average") was spelled incorrectly.
        </p>
        <p>I have no choice but to become more attentive to detail. :) </p>
        <p> Reading error messages carefully is a must now.</p>

        <h3>Problem solving techniques/processes I use</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><span class="code">Pseudocode</span> allows me to break a big problem into a number of sub-problems
                    which significantly simplifies the task since you clearly see what needs to be accomplished. I am
                    getting more and more confident in pseudocoding. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="code">Trying something. </span> I often tend to try something and analise why a certain
                    code block worked or didn't work. I believe experimenting/trying different ways is one of the best
                    approaches of learning to code. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="code">Rubber ducky method</span> is the technique I am just starting to use. Explaining
                    what the problem is step by step can eventually help find the working solution. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="code">Reading error messages</span> is the problem solving technique that I find very
                    helpful. At the current stage of learning I sometimes have to google the error message in order to
                    address the problem.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="code">Console.logging</span> is useful for testing purposes. I am quite confident about using this technique.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="code">Googling.</span> I use this technique very frequently and feel quite confident
                    googling. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><span class="code">Asking your peers/coaches for help.</span> Working on a problem for hours without
                    progressing can be truly tiresome. In this case, it is way more productive to ask for help.</p>
            </li>
